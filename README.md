# PowerShell-FIM

A File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system, simply put, is a system that monitors computer files for the purpose of validating its integrity. It does so by comparing the cryptographic hash value of a known good baseline version of a file to its current state to ensure it hasn't been altered. If altered, it has the ability to notify users if the hash value calculated is different from whatâ€™s stored in the baseline.txt.

**Goal:** The purpose of this project will be to improve upon a FIM Powershell script. The script is capable of collecting new baselines, monitoring files with saved baseline, continuously monitoring files, and notifying users if a file is changed or deleted.
